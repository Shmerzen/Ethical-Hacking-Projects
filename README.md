# Ethical-Hacking-Projects
This is my learning journey for ethical hacking and python (pt. 1)


Each Program has it's own function:

1- arp-sniffer.py : Requires an interface input (can change in the code, at the bottom - to eth0 or other interfaces)
2- arp-spoofer.py : Requires user input of a target (-t or --target) and a spoof IP (-s or --spoof)
3- mac_changer.py : Requires user input of an interface (-i or --interface) and a new MAC address (-m or --mac)
4- network_scanner.py: Requires the user to change the scan range in the code itself
